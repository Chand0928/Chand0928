    <h1>Hello class..</h1>
    <h1>
        “Good morning, and thank you for giving me this opportunity.
My name is Vaibhav. I am currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. I see myself as a full-stack developer who enjoys building complete, real-world applications and continuously improving problem-solving skills.
Starting with my technical background, I primarily work with the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. On the frontend, I am comfortable with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React, and I use modern practices to build responsive and user-friendly interfaces.
On the backend and data side, I have experience with MongoDB, SQL, Python, and I have worked with Pandas and NumPy for basic data handling and analysis. Along with this, I have foundational knowledge of Machine Learning and Generative AI, where I understand core concepts and how these technologies can be applied practically rather than just theoretically.
To strengthen my development skills, I focus heavily on hands-on projects. I believe projects are the best way to learn. I started with basic projects like a Calculator and Tic-Tac-Toe, which helped me understand core logic, state handling, and clean UI design.
After that, I worked on more structured projects like a Food Tracking application, where I focused on user interaction and data handling, and later moved on to my capstone project, where I applied everything I had learned — frontend structure, backend integration, and deployment-oriented thinking.
I have also worked on a complete E-commerce website, which helped me understand real-world features such as product listings, user flow, scalability mindset, and overall application architecture. All my projects and continuous work are available on my GitHub, which I actively maintain:
github.com/Chand0928.
Alongside development, I am very serious about problem-solving and data structures. I have solved 200+ problems on LeetCode, covering arrays, strings, recursion, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and basic dynamic programming.
I also actively participate in CodeChef contests. For the last two months, I haven’t missed a single contest, which reflects my consistency. I am currently a 2-star coder in Division 3, and I maintained an active streak of 67 days, which shows my discipline and long-term commitment rather than short bursts of effort.
Coming to my non-technical background and journey, I believe my past experiences have shaped my mindset strongly. I studied at Sainik School, which taught me discipline, responsibility, and resilience from an early age.
Academically, I have cleared JEE twice, which itself reflects persistence. I also cleared IPMAT, receiving calls from IIM Ranchi and IIM Bodh Gaya. While I eventually chose a different path aligned with technology and innovation, these experiences strengthened my analytical thinking and pressure-handling ability.
I am also interested in public policy, as I believe technology should not exist in isolation but should positively impact society. This perspective helps me think beyond code and focus on purpose-driven solutions.
In summary, I would describe myself as someone who is technically curious, consistent in effort, and mentally resilient. I don’t fear challenges — I use them as feedback to improve. I am now looking for an opportunity where I can apply my skills, learn from experienced professionals, and contribute meaningfully to the organization.
Thank you for listening.”
